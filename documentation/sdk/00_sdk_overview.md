Aleo allows users to privately transact through zero-knowledge enhanced programs. The [Provable SDK](https://github.com/provablehq/sdk) is a collection of JavaScript/Typescript libraries that provides the power to use these programs within the browser and all other levels of the web stack to build privacy-preserving applications.  

The SDK consists of three main libraries:

## [`sdk`](https://github.com/provablehq/sdk/tree/mainnet/sdk)

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@provablehq/sdk"> <img alt="Provable SDK" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/%40provablehq%2Fsdk?label=NPM%20-%20Aleo%20SDK&labelColor=green&color=blue" /></a>


The core SDK library that provides Javascript/Typescript tools for building on and interacting with the Aleo network.


Start here with the [Installation Guide](./guides/01_getting_started.md) and follow the instructions to install the to get started building your first zero knowledge web app.

## [`wasm`](https://github.com/provablehq/sdk/tree/mainnet/wasm)

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@provablehq/wasm"> <img alt="Create Leo App" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/%40provablehq%2Fwasm?label=NPM%20-%20Aleo%20Wasm&labelColor=green&color=blue" /></a>
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/aleo-wasm"> <img alt="Aleo-Wasm" src="https://img.shields.io/crates/v/aleo-wasm.svg?color=neon" /></a>

Aleo Wasm is a Rust crate which compiles Aleo code responsible for creating and executing zero knowledge programs into
WebAssembly.

When compiled with `wasm-pack` JavaScript bindings are generated for the WebAssembly allowing Aleo zero
knowledge programs to be used in the browser and NodeJS. This package is available on NPM (linked above).


## [`create-leo-app`](https://github.com/ProvableHQ/sdk/tree/mainnet/create-leo-app )

<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-leo-app"> <img alt="Create Leo App" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/l/create-leo-app?label=NPM%20-%20Create-Leo-App&labelColor=green&color=blue" /></a>

`create-leo-app` provides zero-knowledge web app examples in common web frameworks such as React. Developers looking to
start with working examples should start here.


You can start with a template by running
```bash
npm create leo-app@latest
```

## Delegated Proving

Provable offers a delegated proving service to accelerate transactions to the Aleo network. Instead of generating proofs locally (which can be resource-intensive), developers can offload the proving work to Provable's infrastructure.

Check out the [Delegated Proving Guide](./delegate-proving/00_delegate_proving.md) to learn how to integrate this service into your application.
